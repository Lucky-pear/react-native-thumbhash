## What is thumbhash?

`thumbhash` is a A very compact representation of a placeholder for an image. Store it inline with your data and show it while the real image is loading for a smoother loading experience.

To know more about thumbhash click [here](https://github.com/evanw/thumbhash).

I recommend you to have a pre-encoded thumbhash string and store it in your server. And when your server delivers an image, you can add thumbhash in your payload. You can now immediately show `<Thumbhash>` component before your `Image` component finishes loading.
